-- in this example, we
-- 1) get taps from anywhere on the screen,
-- 2) add to a list, and
-- 3) use List.map to draw circles at all the points in our list

-- The interesting thing here is that List.map has two inputs, and the first is
-- a function which takes an (x,y) position as an input and outputs a shape.
myShapes model =
   (List.map drawAt model.positions)
     ++
   [ rect 192 128 |> filled (rgba 0 0 0 0) |> notifyTapAt TapAt
   ]
-- Maybe you haven't seen (rgba 0 0 0 0) it is a completely transparent colour,
-- which we want so nobody can see the rect we put on top of the shapes for
-- the user to tap on.

-- This function will draw a red circle at every point you tap.
-- For fun you can make it into something more fun (like a happy face).
-- Remember to use "group" to group a list of shapes into one shape.
